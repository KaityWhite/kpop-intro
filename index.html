        <h1>K-pop Basics</h1>

        <h2>What is K-pop?</h2>
            <p>
                Many people consider K-pop to be just another genre of music. However,
                it is much more than that. Generally speaking, K-pop is any pop music
                that has origins in South Korea. For the most part, that means the production
                company and the singers themselves are either Korean themselves or have just
                lived in Korea before their debut. K-pop acually encompasses a variety of
                genres, including pop, hip-hop, classical, EDM, rock, and many others.
                K-pop is also more than just music. Most, if not all, K-pop artists not only
                sing, but also dance and rap. K-pop artists are also expected to be
                exceptionally attractive.
            </p>

        <h2>What makes K-pop special?</h2>
            <p>
                Some of what makes K-pop stand out from other genres has to do with
                how the artists are trained and the strict rules they have to
                follow. As I mentioned earlier, K-pop artists aren't just singers.
                They're also highly skilled dancers and rappers. They have it all.
                K-pop idols are the complete package and extremely skilled
                entertainers.
            </p>

        <h2>Is K-pop acutally popular?</h2>
            <p>
                K-pop doesn't just have fans in Korea. It has become a
                world-wide phenomenon. You may have heard of "Gangnam Style" by
                the hugely popular idol, Psy. That was one of the first major
                K-pop hits in the US. You may have also heard of BTS. They are the
                first K-pop group to hit #1 on the Billboard Top 100. K-pop is
                enjoyed by millions of people across the world, even despite the
                language bariers. So yeah, it's pretty popular.
